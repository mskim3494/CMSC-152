CS152 Lab 6, Winter 2015

Lab 6 was graded mostly by an automated process, with a quick review
of each submission by either Matthew or Adam. We ran tests on your
implementations, and if tests didn't pass -- commonly because of some
divergence from the file format as specified -- no credit was awarded
for those. Please pardon the terseness of the feedback.

This file was automatically generated for Min Su Kim (mskim3494).
